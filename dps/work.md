Epic: Forge Identity & Personal Branding
As a Creator, I want to control how my identity is displayed on my public Forge profile so that I can choose between absolute privacy and building a recognizable personal brand for social sharing.

User Stories:

1. Identity Toggle: As a user, I want a toggle in my "Profile Settings" to switch between Anonymous Mode (Creator #ID) and Public Identity (Username).
2. Username Display: As a user, when "Public Identity" is enabled, I want my unique username to replace the anonymized placeholder in the Forge profile header, URL, and metadata.
3. SEO Personalization: As a user, I want the meta title and description of my Forge page to automatically update to include my username, making my profile more searchable and professional when shared on social media. 
4. Visual Distinction: As a creator, I want my choice of identity to be reflected in the Content Library as well, so that my contributions are credited to my username rather than a generic ID. 
5. Dynamic URL Binding: As a user, I want the system to handle automatic redirects if I change my identity settings, ensuring that old links to my "Forge" profile don't break for my followers. 
6. Privacy Guardrails: As a user, I want a clear warning that enabling "Public Identity" makes my chosen username visible to the public, while my real name remains strictly hidden and private at all times.
